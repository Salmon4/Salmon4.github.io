    <h2>What is the Google PageRank Algorithm?</h2>
    </center>
    A page rank algorithm is how search engines, like Google, rank their
    search results by measuring their importance. <br> <br>
    The Google Page Rank Algorithm, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin was
    the first algorithm used by Google and was named after one of its founder
    as well as web pages. <br><br>
    It isn't the only algorithm used by Google to order search results as it
    is a business secret. However, it is the most well known as the "initial
    prototype of Google search". <br> <br>
    <br><br>
    <center><h2>What criterias are search results sorted by?</h2></center><br>
    Typically, three factors are considered when measuring the importance/value of web pages:<br><br>
    - The frequency and location of the searched key word. <br><br>
    - How long the web page has existed. <br><br>
    - The number of other web pages that links to the page in question.<br><br>
    Google PageRank focuses on the third factor where each link going into a website
    is considered a "vote" for the website's importance.<br><br><br><br>
